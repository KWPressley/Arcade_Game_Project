# The Classic Road Kill Game
===============================

## Objective of the game:

In this game you have a Player and Enemies (Bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water (top row), without colliding into any one of the enemies. The player can move left, right, up and down. The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene. Once a the player collides with an enemy, the player moves back to the start square. Once the player reaches the water the game is won.  The player has 3 opportunities to reach the top before the game is lost.

## How to play the game:

Once the game has started running, the player icon will be at the bottom of the panel.  Based on the objective of the game, the player is moved by pressing the arrow keys (left, right, up and down).  Move the player to avoid any collisions with the enemy (bugs).  If you can successfully get to the top row (the river) without collisions, you will be the winner.   However, if you have a collision, you have to start over on the home position.   But don't frown yet!  You have 3 lives to get to the top.  But you will frown if you collide 3 times - because you will then lose the game.

### Required for executing Game
